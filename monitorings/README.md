# Run Airflow locally

## Install docker compose
You'll need to install docker compose to run and test your DAGs locally.
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Installing docker engine should be enough. To check your docker compose version you can use the `docker compose version` command.

## Run the docker compose command
This should be sufficient to run airflow in your machine.
```
$ docker compose up
```
